          <p>
            Prior to Vanguard, I worked in various restaurants. I took a leap in
            to a drastically different industry in order to work for a company
            that challenged and developed me, while also enhancing my quality of
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I possess a strong interest in advancing Vanguard’s mission through
            Diversity & Inclusion; I believe it to be our key strategic
            differential and one that is personal for me.
          </p>
          <h3 class="secondary-title">Personal Points of Interest</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have traveled to 32 Countries and 6 continents. Trying for 40 by
              40 yrs.
            </li>
            <li>I am a dog lover (especially my pup Spartacus).</li>
            <li>
              I was in a high speed taxi chase around Istanbul for over an hour
              trying to recover my husband’s phone, which he accidentally left
              in another taxi.

          <h3 class="secondary-title">Next Step: Chief of Staff</h3>
          <h4 class="secondary-title">Why:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I aspire to rapidly advance my thought leadership and strategic
              mindset with exposure to senior leadership’s experiences and
              perspectives.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Chief of Staff role will afford me the opportunity to tie my
              passion and experiences on the front-line to my years of working
              externally, both of which have crafted my diversity of thought and
              strategic mindset. This blend of skills will help push our
              critical Vanguard mission forward.
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe in the RMS mission and Vanguard’s brand. I would love to
              work in a position that I can dramatically impact how we continue
              to evolve and adapt our business. In the Chief of Staff role, I
              will get to be part of that evolution by being at the table where
              those decisions are made.
